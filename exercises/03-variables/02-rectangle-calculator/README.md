# Exercise 2: Rectangle Calculator

Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle using variables.

## 📖 Before You Start

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Complete Exercise 1 first!**

Make sure you have successfully completed the "Personal Information" exercise.

## 🎯 Goal

Write a program that calculates and displays the area and perimeter of a rectangle using variables.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- How to perform calculations with variables
- How to use variables in mathematical expressions
- How to display calculated results

## 📝 Instructions

1. **Open the file**: Look at the `main.py` file in this folder
2. **Write your code**: Create variables for width and height, then calculate area and perimeter
3. **Test your code**: Run your script to see if it works:
   ```bash
   python exercises/03-variables/02-rectangle-calculator/main.py
   ```
4. **Check with tests**: Run the automated test to verify your solution:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_03_variables.py::TestExercise03_02::test_rectangle_calculations
   ```

## 💡 Hints

- Area = width × height
- Perimeter = 2 × (width + height)
- Use descriptive variable names like `width`, `height`, `area`, `perimeter`

## ✅ Expected Output

When you run your program, you should see:
```
Rectangle width: 5
Rectangle height: 3
Area: 15
Perimeter: 16
```

## 🎉 Success!

Once your program works, you've successfully:
- ✅ Used variables in mathematical calculations
- ✅ Performed arithmetic operations
- ✅ Displayed calculated results clearly

Excellent work with calculations! 🚀
