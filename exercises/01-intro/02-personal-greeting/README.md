# Exercise 2: Personal Greeting

Create a program that displays a personalized greeting with your name and a welcome message.

## 📖 Before You Start

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Complete Exercise 1 first!**

Make sure you have successfully completed the "Hello, World!" exercise before attempting this one.

## 🎯 Goal

Write a Python program that prints your name on one line and a welcome message on another line.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- How to print multiple lines of text
- How to structure a simple program with multiple statements
- The importance of program sequence

## 📝 Instructions

1. **Open the file**: Look at the `main.py` file in this folder
2. **Write your code**: Add Python code that will print your name and a welcome message
3. **Test your code**: Run your script to see if it works:
   ```bash
   python exercises/01-intro/02-personal-greeting/main.py
   ```
4. **Check with tests**: Run the automated test to verify your solution:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_01_intro.py::TestExercise01_02::test_contains_name_and_welcome
   ```

## 💡 Hints

- Use two separate `print()` statements
- Each `print()` creates a new line
- Replace the example name with your actual name

## ✅ Expected Output

When you run your program, you should see:
```
Anna
Welcome to Python programming!
```

## 🎉 Success!

Once your program works, you've successfully:
- ✅ Created a multi-line program
- ✅ Used multiple `print()` statements
- ✅ Learned about program sequence

Great work! You're building more complex programs already. 🚀
