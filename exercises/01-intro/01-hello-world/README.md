# Exercise 1: Hello, World!

Welcome to your first Python exercise! This is the traditional first program that every programmer writes.

## 📖 Before You Start

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read Chapter 1 first!**

Before attempting this exercise, make sure you have:
- ✅ Read **Chapter 1: Introduction to Python** in the `book/01-intro.md` file
- ✅ Installed Python and verified it works (`python --version`)
- ✅ Set up VS Code or your preferred code editor

This exercise is designed to verify that your development environment is properly configured as described in Chapter 1.

## 🎯 Goal

Write a Python program that displays "Hello, World!" in the console. This exercise will confirm that your development environment is set up correctly and working.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- How to use `print()` to display text
- How to run a Python file with the `python` command
- The basic structure of a Python program

## 📝 Instructions

1. **Open the file**: Look at the `main.py` file in this folder
2. **Write your code**: Add Python code that will print "Hello, World!" to the console
3. **Test your code**: Run your script to see if it works:
   ```bash
   python exercises/01-intro/01-hello-world/main.py
   ```
4. **Check with tests**: Run the automated test to verify your solution:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_01_intro.py::TestExercise01_01::test_hello_world_output
   ```

## 💡 Hints

- Use the `print()` function to display text
- Put your text inside quotes: `"Hello, World!"`
- Python doesn't require semicolons at the end of lines

## ✅ Expected Output

When you run your program, you should see:
```
Hello, World!
```

## 🎉 Success!

Once your program works, you've successfully:
- ✅ Written your first Python program
- ✅ Confirmed your development environment is working
- ✅ Learned how to use `print()`
