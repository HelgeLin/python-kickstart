# Exercise 3: Comments and Code

Learn how to add comments to your Python code to make it more readable and understandable.

## 📖 Before You Start

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Complete Exercise 2 first!**

Make sure you have successfully completed the "Personal Greeting" exercise before attempting this one.

## 🎯 Goal

Write a Python program that prints three different messages with explanatory comments before each `print()` statement.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- How to write comments in Python using `#`
- Why comments are important for code readability
- How comments are ignored by Python when running the program

## 📝 Instructions

1. **Open the file**: Look at the `main.py` file in this folder
2. **Write your code**: Add three `print()` statements with comments explaining each one
3. **Test your code**: Run your script to see if it works:
   ```bash
   python exercises/01-intro/03-comments-and-code/main.py
   ```
4. **Check with tests**: Run the automated test to verify your solution:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_01_intro.py::TestExercise01_03::test_three_messages_with_comments
   ```

## 💡 Hints

- Comments start with `#` and can be on their own line or after code
- Comments help explain what your code does
- Python ignores comments when running the program

## ✅ Expected Output

When you run your program, you should see:
```
Good morning!
How are you?
Have a great day!
```

## 🎉 Success!

Once your program works, you've successfully:
- ✅ Used comments to document your code
- ✅ Created a well-structured program
- ✅ Learned about code readability

Comments are essential for writing maintainable code. Great job! 🚀
