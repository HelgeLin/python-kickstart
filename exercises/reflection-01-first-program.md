# Reflection Task 01: My First Programming Experience

## Background
Programming is more than just writing code—it's about problem-solving, creativity, and learning from mistakes. This reflection task gives you time to think about your journey so far.

## Instructions
Write a short reflection (200-300 words) answering the following questions. You can write this in a document, notebook, or even discuss it with a friend/teacher.

## Reflection Questions

1. **What surprised you most** about writing your first Python programs? Was it easier or harder than you expected?

2. **Describe a moment** when you got stuck on an exercise. What was the problem, and how did you solve it? What did you learn from that experience?

3. **How is programming like something else** you've done before? (For example, cooking a recipe, following directions, building with blocks, etc.)

4. **What's one thing** you want to be able to do with Python that you can't do yet? How might you learn that skill?

5. **How do you feel** about programming now compared to before you started this course? What are you most excited about?

## Sharing Your Reflection

- **With your teacher:** Share your thoughts during class discussion
- **With classmates:** Compare your experiences and learn from each other
- **For yourself:** Keep this reflection to look back on later in the course

## Why This Matters

Reflecting on your learning helps you:
- Understand your progress
- Identify what you enjoy about programming
- Recognize areas where you want to improve
- Build confidence in your abilities

Remember, everyone starts as a beginner. Your first programs don't have to be perfect—they just have to work!
