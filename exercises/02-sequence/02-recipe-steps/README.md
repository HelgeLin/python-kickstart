# Exercise 2: Recipe Steps

Create a program that shows the steps to make a simple sandwich, demonstrating program sequence with comments.

## 📖 Before You Start

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Complete Exercise 1 first!**

Make sure you have successfully completed the "Morning Routine" exercise.

## 🎯 Goal

Write a Python program that prints at least 5 steps to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, with comments organizing the steps.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- How to use comments to organize code sections
- How sequence applies to real-world processes
- Combining comments and code for better readability

## 📝 Instructions

1. **Open the file**: Look at the `main.py` file in this folder
2. **Write your code**: Add steps for making a sandwich with explanatory comments
3. **Test your code**: Run your script to see if it works:
   ```bash
   python exercises/02-sequence/02-recipe-steps/main.py
   ```
4. **Check with tests**: Run the automated test to verify your solution:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_02_sequence.py::TestExercise02_02::test_recipe_steps_with_comments
   ```

## 💡 Hints

- Comments start with `#` and help organize your code
- Think about the logical order of making a sandwich
- Make the steps clear and easy to follow

## ✅ Expected Output

When you run your program, you should see:
```
Get two slices of bread
Spread peanut butter on one slice
Spread jelly on the other slice
Put the slices together
Enjoy your sandwich!
```

## 🎉 Success!

Once your program works, you've successfully:
- ✅ Used comments to organize code
- ✅ Created a sequential process
- ✅ Combined documentation with functionality

Great work on understanding program flow! 🚀
