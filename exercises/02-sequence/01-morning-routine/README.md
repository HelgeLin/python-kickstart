# Exercise 1: Morning Routine

Create a program that shows the sequence of activities in a morning routine.

## 📖 Before You Start

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read Chapter 2 first!**

Before attempting this exercise, make sure you have:
- ✅ Read **Chapter 2: Program Sequence** in the `book/02-sequence.md` file
- ✅ Completed the Chapter 1 exercises

## 🎯 Goal

Write a Python program that prints at least 4 steps of a morning routine in the correct order.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- How programs execute statements in sequence
- How to create multi-line output
- The importance of logical order in programming

## 📝 Instructions

1. **Open the file**: Look at the `main.py` file in this folder
2. **Write your code**: Add Python code that prints morning routine steps
3. **Test your code**: Run your script to see if it works:
   ```bash
   python exercises/02-sequence/01-morning-routine/main.py
   ```
4. **Check with tests**: Run the automated test to verify your solution:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_02_sequence.py::TestExercise02_01::test_morning_routine_sequence
   ```

## 💡 Hints

- Think of activities you do every morning
- Each `print()` creates a new line
- Keep the steps in logical order

## ✅ Expected Output

When you run your program, you should see:
```
Wake up
Brush teeth
Eat breakfast
Go to school
```

## 🎉 Success!

Once your program works, you've successfully:
- ✅ Created a program with multiple statements
- ✅ Demonstrated understanding of program sequence
- ✅ Used `print()` for multiple lines of output

Great work understanding how programs flow! 🚀
