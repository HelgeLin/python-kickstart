# Exercise 3: Story Sequence

Create a short story program that demonstrates clear sequence with a beginning, middle, and end.

## 📖 Before You Start

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Complete Exercise 2 first!**

Make sure you have successfully completed the "Recipe Steps" exercise.

## 🎯 Goal

Write a Python program that tells a short story with at least 6 events in sequence.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- How to structure a narrative with clear progression
- Using sequence to create meaningful output
- Combining multiple statements for storytelling

## 📝 Instructions

1. **Open the file**: Look at the `main.py` file in this folder
2. **Write your code**: Create a short story with clear sequence
3. **Test your code**: Run your script to see if it works:
   ```bash
   python exercises/02-sequence/03-story-sequence/main.py
   ```
4. **Check with tests**: Run the automated test to verify your solution:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_02_sequence.py::TestExercise02_03::test_story_sequence
   ```

## 💡 Hints

- Stories have a clear progression: beginning → middle → end
- Use blank lines between paragraphs if it helps readability
- Keep the story simple but complete

## ✅ Expected Output

When you run your program, you should see something like:
```
Once upon a time, there was a curious programmer.
She decided to learn Python.
She wrote her first program.
It printed "Hello, World!"
She was very happy.
And she coded happily ever after.
```

## 🎉 Success!

Once your program works, you've successfully:
- ✅ Created a narrative with clear sequence
- ✅ Used multiple statements effectively
- ✅ Demonstrated understanding of program flow

Excellent work on sequencing! 🚀
