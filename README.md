# Python Kickstart

A beginner-friendly Python curriculum for Programming 1 (PRRPRR01), designed to teach programming fundamentals through hands-on exercises and projects.

## Overview

Python Kickstart provides a structured learning path for students new to programming, featuring:

- **Interactive Chapters**: Step-by-step lessons covering Python basics
- **Auto-tested Exercises**: Immediate feedback on coding tasks
- **Open-ended Projects**: Creative opportunities for exploration
- **Teacher Resources**: Solutions, rubrics, and classroom guides

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- VS Code with Python extension
- Git for version control

### Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Follow the [VS Code Setup Guide](docs/vscode-setup.md)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start with Chapter 1 in the `book/` directory

## Testing Your Code

This course uses automated tests to give you instant feedback on your exercises. Here's how to test your solutions:

### Test a Single Exercise
```bash
# Example: Test your Chapter 1, Exercise 1 solution
pytest tests/test_01_intro.py::TestExercise01_01::test_hello_world_output -v
```

### Test All Exercises in a Chapter
```bash
# Example: Test all Chapter 1 exercises
pytest tests/test_01_intro.py -v
```

### Test Everything
```bash
# Test all exercises across all chapters
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Understanding Test Results
- ‚úÖ **PASSED**: Your solution works correctly!
- ‚ùå **FAILED**: Check the error message to see what needs to be fixed
- üìù **Tip**: Tests check both your program's output and code structure

For more detailed testing information, see [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md).
