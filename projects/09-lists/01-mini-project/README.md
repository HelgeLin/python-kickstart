# Mini-Project: Student Grade Tracker

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Create an interactive student grade tracking system that uses lists to store and analyze academic performance data. This project builds upon the list concepts from Chapter 9 and demonstrates how to work with collections of related data for educational analytics.

## ðŸ“– Project Description

Build a grade tracker that:
- Uses lists to store student names, subjects, and grades
- Calculates various academic statistics (averages, highest/lowest grades)
- Provides detailed performance analysis and recommendations
- Demonstrates the power of lists for managing educational data
- Shows how to work with parallel lists for related information

This project introduces comprehensive data management - a key technique for the final capstone project!

## ðŸ§  What You'll Practice

This project reinforces concepts from **Chapter 9: Lists**:
- [Creating lists](../../../book/09-lists.md#creating-lists) to store collections of academic data
- [Accessing list elements](../../../book/09-lists.md#accessing-list-elements) by index and value
- [Lists and loops](../../../book/09-lists.md#lists-and-loops) for processing grade collections
- [List methods](../../../book/09-lists.md#list-methods) for adding and managing data
- [Parallel lists](../../../book/09-lists.md#working-with-multiple-lists) for related information

**Building on previous exercises:**
- Unlike simple list exercises, this creates a comprehensive data management system
- Demonstrates parallel lists for managing related data (names, subjects, grades)
- Uses lists with functions for organized data processing
- Shows practical application of list operations for real-world problems

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Open `main.py` in this folder**

2. **Follow the step-by-step approach:**
   - Start by creating basic lists for students, subjects, and grades
   - Add functions to add new grades and display data
   - Implement statistical calculations using list operations
   - Add performance analysis and recommendations
   - Test with various student data scenarios

3. **Test your project:** `python main.py`

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Ideas

### Approach 1: Basic Parallel Lists
```python
# Create parallel lists (same index = related data)
students = []
subjects = []
grades = []

def add_grade(student_name, subject_name, grade_value):
    """Add a new grade to the tracking system"""
    students.append(student_name)
    subjects.append(subject_name)
    grades.append(grade_value)
    print("Grade added successfully!")

def display_all_grades():
    """Display all grades organized by student"""
    print("\n=== All Grades ===")
    
    # Get unique students
    unique_students = list(set(students))
    
    for student in unique_students:
        print(f"Student: {student}")
        for i in range(len(students)):
            if students[i] == student:
                print(f"- {subjects[i]}: {grades[i]}")
        print()

# Test the functions
add_grade("Alice Johnson", "Mathematics", 87)
add_grade("Alice Johnson", "Science", 92)
display_all_grades()
```

### Approach 2: Statistical Calculations
```python
def calculate_class_average():
    """Calculate the overall class average"""
    if len(grades) == 0:
        return 0
    return sum(grades) / len(grades)

def find_highest_grade():
    """Find the highest grade and who achieved it"""
    if len(grades) == 0:
        return None, None, None
    
    max_grade = max(grades)
    max_index = grades.index(max_grade)
    return max_grade, students[max_index], subjects[max_index]

def find_lowest_grade():
    """Find the lowest grade and who achieved it"""
    if len(grades) == 0:
        return None, None, None
    
    min_grade = min(grades)
    min_index = grades.index(min_grade)
    return min_grade, students[min_index], subjects[min_index]

def calculate_subject_averages():
    """Calculate average grade for each subject"""
    subject_totals = {}
    subject_counts = {}
    
    for i in range(len(subjects)):
        subject = subjects[i]
        grade = grades[i]
        
        if subject in subject_totals:
            subject_totals[subject] += grade
            subject_counts[subject] += 1
        else:
            subject_totals[subject] = grade
            subject_counts[subject] = 1
    
    subject_averages = {}
    for subject in subject_totals:
        subject_averages[subject] = subject_totals[subject] / subject_counts[subject]
    
    return subject_averages
```

### Approach 3: Performance Analysis
```python
def calculate_student_averages():
    """Calculate average grade for each student"""
    student_totals = {}
    student_counts = {}
    
    for i in range(len(students)):
        student = students[i]
        grade = grades[i]
        
        if student in student_totals:
            student_totals[student] += grade
            student_counts[student] += 1
        else:
            student_totals[student] = grade
            student_counts[student] = 1
    
    student_averages = {}
    for student in student_totals:
        student_averages[student] = student_totals[student] / student_counts[student]
    
    return student_averages

def get_performance_level(average):
    """Convert numeric average to performance level"""
    if average >= 90:
        return "Excellent"
    elif average >= 80:
        return "Good"
    elif average >= 70:
        return "Satisfactory"
    elif average >= 60:
        return "Needs Improvement"
    else:
        return "Requires Attention"

def performance_analysis():
    """Provide detailed performance analysis"""
    print("\n=== Performance Analysis ===")
    
    # Student performance
    student_averages = calculate_student_averages()
    print("Student Performance:")
    for student, average in student_averages.items():
        level = get_performance_level(average)
        print(f"- {student}: Average {average:.1f} ({level})")
    
    # Subject analysis
    subject_averages = calculate_subject_averages()
    print("\nSubject Analysis:")
    for subject, average in subject_averages.items():
        print(f"- {subject}: {average:.1f} average")
    
    # Recommendations
    print("\nRecommendations:")
    if subject_averages:
        weakest_subject = min(subject_averages, key=subject_averages.get)
        strongest_subject = max(subject_averages, key=subject_averages.get)
        print(f"- Focus on {weakest_subject} improvement")
        print(f"- {strongest_subject} is the strongest subject")
```
