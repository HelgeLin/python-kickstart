# Additional Project: Word Counter

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Create a text analysis tool that counts words, characters, and provides statistics about text input. This project combines concepts from multiple chapters to create a useful utility program.

## ðŸ“– Project Description

Build a word counter that:
- Accepts text input from the user
- Counts words, characters, sentences, and paragraphs
- Analyzes text statistics (average word length, most common words)
- Provides detailed text analysis reports
- Demonstrates practical application of string processing and data analysis

This project is perfect for practicing text processing, functions, and data analysis!

## ðŸŽ® Example Interaction

```
=== Word Counter Tool ===
Enter your text (press Enter twice to finish):
Python is a powerful programming language.
It is easy to learn and versatile.

=== Text Analysis Report ===
Basic Statistics:
- Characters (with spaces): 78
- Characters (without spaces): 65
- Words: 13
- Sentences: 2
- Paragraphs: 1

Word Analysis:
- Average word length: 5.0 characters
- Longest word: "programming" (11 characters)
- Shortest word: "a" (1 character)

Most Common Words:
1. "is" (appears 2 times)
2. "to" (appears 1 time)
3. "and" (appears 1 time)

Reading Statistics:
- Estimated reading time: 3 seconds
- Reading level: Intermediate
```

## ðŸ§  Concepts Applied

This project demonstrates mastery of:
- **Input/Output** (Chapter 5) â†’ Multi-line text input and formatted reports
- **Selections** (Chapter 6) â†’ Conditional analysis and categorization
- **Iterations** (Chapter 7) â†’ Processing text character by character and word by word
- **Functions** (Chapter 8) â†’ Organized text processing functions
- **Lists** (Chapter 9) â†’ Managing collections of words and statistics

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Ideas
