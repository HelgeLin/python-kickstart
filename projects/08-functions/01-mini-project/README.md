# Mini-Project: Personal Finance Tracker

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Create a modular personal finance tracker that uses functions to organize different financial calculations and operations. This project builds upon the function concepts from Chapter 8 and demonstrates how to create a well-structured application with reusable code components.

## ðŸ“– Project Description

Build a finance tracker that:
- Uses separate functions for different financial calculations (budget, savings, expenses)
- Has a main program loop that presents financial management options
- Separates calculation logic from user interface logic
- Demonstrates how functions make financial code more organized and reusable
- Allows users to track multiple financial aspects in one session

This shows the power of functions for organizing complex financial logic!

## ðŸ§  What You'll Practice

This project reinforces concepts from **Chapter 8: Functions**:
- [Defining functions](../../../book/08-functions.md#defining-functions) with parameters and return values
- [Calling functions](../../../book/08-functions.md#calling-functions) from different parts of your program
- [Multiple parameters](../../../book/08-functions.md#parameters-and-arguments) for financial calculations
- [Return values](../../../book/08-functions.md#return-values) to get calculation results
- [Function organization](../../../book/08-functions.md#organizing-code-with-functions) for clean code structure

**Building on previous exercises:**
- Unlike simple calculation functions, this creates a complete financial application
- Demonstrates functions working together to solve complex problems
- Shows how to separate concerns (UI vs calculations vs data processing)
- Uses functions for both calculations and user interface management

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Open `main.py` in this folder**

2. **Follow the step-by-step approach:**
   - Start by creating basic financial calculation functions
   - Test each function individually with sample data
   - Create the menu display and navigation functions
   - Add the main program loop
   - Test the complete application with real scenarios

3. **Test your project:** `python main.py`

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Ideas

### Approach 1: Basic Financial Functions
```python
def calculate_budget(income, expenses):
    """Calculate budget surplus/deficit and savings rate"""
    remaining = income - expenses
    savings_rate = (remaining / income) * 100 if income > 0 else 0
    return remaining, savings_rate

def calculate_savings_goal(goal_amount, current_savings, monthly_savings):
    """Calculate months needed to reach savings goal"""
    remaining_needed = goal_amount - current_savings
    if monthly_savings <= 0:
        return float('inf')  # Never reach goal
    months_needed = remaining_needed / monthly_savings
    return max(0, months_needed)  # Can't be negative

def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounds_per_year=12):
    """Calculate compound interest for investments"""
    amount = principal * (1 + rate/compounds_per_year) ** (compounds_per_year * time)
    return amount

# Test your functions
print(calculate_budget(3500, 2800))  # Should return (700, 20.0)
print(calculate_savings_goal(10000, 2500, 400))  # Should return 18.75
```

### Approach 2: User Interface Functions
```python
def show_main_menu():
    """Display the main menu options"""
    print("\n=== Personal Finance Tracker ===")
    print("1. Budget Calculator")
    print("2. Savings Goal Tracker")
    print("3. Expense Analyzer")
    print("4. Investment Calculator")
    print("5. Exit")

def get_user_choice():
    """Get and validate user menu choice"""
    while True:
        choice = input("Enter your choice (1-5): ")
        if choice in ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']:
            return choice
        print("Please enter a valid choice (1-5)")

def get_positive_number(prompt):
    """Get a positive number from user with validation"""
    while True:
        try:
            value = float(input(prompt))
            if value >= 0:
                return value
            print("Please enter a positive number.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")
```

### Approach 3: Feature-Specific Functions
```python
def budget_calculator():
    """Handle the budget calculator feature"""
    print("\n=== Budget Calculator ===")
    income = get_positive_number("Enter your monthly income: ")
    expenses = get_positive_number("Enter your monthly expenses: ")
    
    remaining, savings_rate = calculate_budget(income, expenses)
    
    print(f"\nBudget Analysis:")
    print(f"- Monthly Income: ${income:,.2f}")
    print(f"- Monthly Expenses: ${expenses:,.2f}")
    print(f"- Remaining Budget: ${remaining:,.2f}")
    print(f"- Savings Rate: {savings_rate:.1f}%")
    
    # Provide recommendations
    if savings_rate >= 20:
        print("Recommendation: Excellent! You're saving well.")
    elif savings_rate >= 10:
        print("Recommendation: Good savings rate. Consider increasing if possible.")
    elif savings_rate > 0:
        print("Recommendation: Try to increase your savings rate to at least 10%.")
    else:
        print("Recommendation: You're spending more than you earn. Review your expenses.")

def savings_goal_tracker():
    """Handle the savings goal tracker feature"""
    print("\n=== Savings Goal Tracker ===")
    goal = get_positive_number("Enter your savings goal: ")
    current = get_positive_number("Enter your current savings: ")
    monthly = get_positive_number("Enter monthly savings amount: ")
    
    months_needed = calculate_savings_goal(goal, current, monthly)
    
    print(f"\nSavings Goal Analysis:")
    print(f"- Goal Amount: ${goal:,.2f}")
    print(f"- Current Savings: ${current:,.2f}")
    print(f"- Remaining Needed: ${goal - current:,.2f}")
    print(f"- Monthly Savings: ${monthly:,.2f}")
    
    if months_needed == float('inf'):
        print("- Time to Goal: Never (need positive monthly savings)")
    else:
        print(f"- Months to Goal: {months_needed:.0f} months")
        
    if monthly > 0 and months_needed < float('inf'):
        if months_needed <= 12:
            print("Recommendation: You'll reach your goal within a year!")
        elif months_needed <= 24:
            print("Recommendation: Good progress, stay consistent!")
        else:
            print("Recommendation: Consider increasing monthly savings if possible.")
```
