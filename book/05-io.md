# Chapter 05: Input and Output

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand what Input/Output (I/O) means in programming
- Use `print()` to display output with various formatting options
- Get user input using the `input()` function
- Convert string input to numbers when needed
- Create interactive programs that respond to user input
- Use Python's f-string formatting for clean output

## Introduction

Input and Output (I/O) is how programs communicate with users. Without I/O, programs would be like calculators that can't show results or games that can't respond to player actions. With I/O, programs become interactive, personalized, and useful for solving real-world problems.

- **Input** → Information going INTO the program (from user to computer)
- **Output** → Information coming OUT of the program (from computer to user)

## Core Concepts

### Output with print()

You've already been using `print()` for output! Python's `print()` function is powerful and flexible.

#### Basic Output
```python
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python programming!")
```

#### Printing Variables
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name)
print(age)
print(name, age)  # Print multiple values
```

#### Python's f-string Formatting (Recommended)
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
score = 95.7

# f-strings make output clean and readable
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
print(f"You are {age} years old.")
print(f"Your score is {score:.1f}")  # One decimal place
```

#### Other Formatting Options
```python
# String concatenation (older method)
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# .format() method (older method)
print("Hello, {}! You are {} years old.".format(name, age))

# Multiple print parameters
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)
```

### Input with input()

Python's built-in `input()` function gets text from the user. It always returns a string, even if the user types numbers.

#### Basic Input
```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

#### Input with Prompts
```python
favorite_color = input("What's your favorite color? ")
hobby = input("What's your favorite hobby? ")

print(f"You like {favorite_color} and enjoy {hobby}.")
```

### Working with Numbers from Input

**Important**: `input()` always returns a string! To work with numbers, you must convert them.

#### The Problem
```python
num1 = input("Enter first number: ")  # "10" (string)
num2 = input("Enter second number: ") # "5" (string)
result = num1 + num2                  # "105" (string concatenation!)
print(f"Sum: {result}")               # "Sum: 105" (wrong!)
```

#### The Solution: Type Conversion
```python
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))    # Convert to integer
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))   # Convert to integer
result = num1 + num2                         # 15 (addition!)
print(f"Sum: {result}")                      # "Sum: 15" (correct!)
```

#### Conversion Functions
```python
# Convert to integer
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Convert to float (decimal numbers)
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

# Keep as string (no conversion needed)
name = input("Enter your name: ")
```

### Python's Unique I/O Features

#### Multiple Assignment from Input
```python
# Get multiple values in one line (advanced)
data = input("Enter name, age, city (separated by commas): ")
name, age, city = data.split(", ")
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, City: {city}")
```

#### Input Validation (Preview)
```python
# Basic validation example
age_input = input("Enter your age: ")
if age_input.isdigit():
    age = int(age_input)
    print(f"You are {age} years old.")
else:
    print("Please enter a valid number.")
```

## Practical Applications

### Personal Information Collector
```python
print("=== Personal Information ===")
name = input("Full name: ")
age = int(input("Age: "))
height = float(input("Height (in meters): "))
city = input("City: ")

print(f"\n=== Your Profile ===")
print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Age: {age} years old")
print(f"Height: {height}m")
print(f"Location: {city}")
```

### Simple Calculator
```python
print("=== Simple Calculator ===")
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

print(f"\nResults:")
print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}")
print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}")
print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}")
print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2:.2f}")
```

### Temperature Converter
```python
print("=== Temperature Converter ===")
celsius = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32

print(f"{celsius}°C = {fahrenheit:.1f}°F")

if fahrenheit >= 68 and fahrenheit <= 78:
    print("That's a comfortable temperature!")
else:
    print("That might be too hot or too cold for some people.")
```

## Advanced Formatting

### F-string Formatting Options
```python
name = "Alice"
score = 87.6789
price = 19.99

# Basic f-string
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Number formatting
print(f"Score: {score:.2f}")      # 2 decimal places: 87.68
print(f"Price: ${price:.2f}")     # Currency: $19.99

# Padding and alignment
print(f"Name: {name:>10}")        # Right-align in 10 characters
print(f"Name: {name:<10}")        # Left-align in 10 characters
print(f"Name: {name:^10}")        # Center-align in 10 characters
```

### Multi-line Output
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
city = "Stockholm"

# Multi-line f-string
info = f"""
=== User Profile ===
Name: {name}
Age: {age}
City: {city}
==================
"""
print(info)
```

## Common Mistakes

### Forgetting Type Conversion
```python
# Wrong - trying to do math with strings
age = input("Age: ")  # Returns string
next_year = age + 1   # Error! Can't add string and number

# Correct - convert to number first
age = int(input("Age: "))
next_year = age + 1
```

### Not Handling Invalid Input
```python
# Fragile - crashes if user enters non-number
age = int(input("Age: "))  # Crashes if user types "abc"

# Better - check if input is valid (we'll learn more about this later)
age_input = input("Age: ")
if age_input.isdigit():
    age = int(age_input)
else:
    print("Please enter a valid number")
```

### Mixing Old and New String Formatting
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25

# Inconsistent - mixing different styles
print("Hello, " + name + "!")           # String concatenation
print(f"You are {age} years old.")      # f-string

# Better - use f-strings consistently
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
print(f"You are {age} years old.")
```

## Best Practices

### Use Clear Prompts
```python
# Poor prompts
x = input("x: ")
y = input("y: ")

# Clear prompts
width = float(input("Enter rectangle width (in meters): "))
height = float(input("Enter rectangle height (in meters): "))
```

### Use f-strings for Output
```python
name = "Alice"
score = 95

# Old way (avoid)
print("Hello, " + name + "! Your score is " + str(score))

# Modern way (preferred)
print(f"Hello, {name}! Your score is {score}")
```

### Organize Your Output
```python
print("=== Calculator Results ===")
print(f"Input 1: {num1}")
print(f"Input 2: {num2}")
print(f"Sum: {num1 + num2}")
print(f"Product: {num1 * num2}")
print("=" * 25)  # Creates a line of = characters
```
